# Multi-Objective-Reverse-Learning
This is a framework for reverse learning. Reverse learning is the concept of predicting the values of input features from the output feature of a predictor or predictors. Here, an example with concrete design is used, for two objectives. It is still in the developing phase.
This is a part of my undergrad thesis titled Optimizing Concrete Mix Design Against Chloride-Induced Corrosion Using Machine Learning, which is being published.
